# Thesis
- degree: "Master's Thesis : Reliability Analysis of Mechanical Equipment in a Cement Production Plant"
  year: 2018 &mdash; 2019
  summary:
    - point: Developed an integrated predictive model (accounting for event history, condition monitoring, and production throughput) used it to identify the reliability of the mechanical equipment, and made maintenance-specific recommendations to improve reliability.
    - point: Used R and Python, to perform extensive preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, and integration of 3 years of stoppage records, vibration measurements, and monthly production totals coming from flat files of various formats (HTML, Excel).
    - point: Performed extensive feature extraction including text mining, natural language processing, and part-of- speech tagging to identify the failure mechanism, maintenance action, and repair status for each failure event.
    - point: Performed a criticality analysis (identifying cement mills and fans as the most critical equipment), disproved presence of trend in inter-failure durations, and identified the potential for event clustering.
    - point: Estimated semi-parametric (stratified extended Cox) and fully parametric (accelerated failure time) models and determined that decreasing production load and replacing (compared to repairing) broken components significantly decreased the risk of failures in cement mills and fans.

- degree: Bachelor of Science, Informatics
  uni: University of Michigan
  year: 2009 &mdash; 2014
  description: Through the Informatics program, I explored a cross-disciplinary approach to the intersection of technology and human interaction. I learned concepts including complex networks (technical and relational), statistics, mathematics, data analysis, usability, and object-oriented programming.
